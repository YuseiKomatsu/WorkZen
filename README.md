## 🎯 About This Project

Modern desk workers face serious health risks described as "sitting is the new smoking." However, existing solutions only provide temporary fixes and fail to achieve true harmony between work and wellness.

WorkZen is a desktop application that aims to help users naturally build healthy habits without sacrificing work productivity.

## 💭 Development Story

This project started from personal experience. As an engineer, I felt anxiety about health issues and faced challenges that existing tools couldn't solve.

- Health management should be "part of daily routine," not "special time"
- Want to maintain health without disrupting work focus
- Sustainable habit formation is the essential solution
